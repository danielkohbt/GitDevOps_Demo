  	  <h2><em><strong>Hi, I'm</strong></em></h2>
	  <h2> Daniel Koh</h2>
	  <p> <em>I have now been working in the Information Technology industry for more than 30 years. The time that obtained my Master of Business in Information Technology degree from RMIT University (Australia) was in year 2000. Before becoming an independent business advisor, I spent ten years working as a business consultant, assisting organizations with their business, IT operational issues and HR transformation challenges. My work with many executives from mid to senior executive level are in area of championing business process improvement with design thinking methodologies. This work has enabled me to help many enterprises transformed their siloed operations to be aligned with their overall business strategy, resulted in achieving improved business performance. My experience working inside organizations has provided me with an appreciation of how business process improvement initiatives can greatly affect organization effectiveness and efficiency. My goal and passion is to help clients focus on the right thing, making the right change at the efficient way possible to acheive sustainable value for their enterprises.</em> </p>
